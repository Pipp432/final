# AVL tree
## Basic & Introduction
&nbsp;&nbsp;AVL tree was created to solve a problem with BST. Consider the case where the data is input in a sorted manner (ascending or descending). A problem will arise that the searching algorithms will have time complexity of O(n) so AVL is created to help balance the tree.

&nbsp;&nbsp;AVL tree named after its inventors: Adelson, Velski & Landis
The structure of the tree is very similar to BST but with one big differrence that is the **_Balance Factor._**

The balance factor can be calculated by:
```java
BalanceFactor = height(leftSubtree) âˆ’ height(rightSubtree)
```
This can be applied to each node to see its balance factor

An AVL tree is considered **_balance_** if the nodes have a balance factor of -1, 0 or 1.

## AVL operation
These are very similar to BST

| Algorithm        | Time Complexity |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Search    | O(log n) | 
| Insert    | O(log n) |     
| Delete    | O(log n) |      

## AVL Rotations
These are preformed on the AVL tree if the balance factors are not -1, 0 or 1.
There are 4 types of AVL rotations.

| Unbalance State      | Operation | Action|
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| Right Right Unbalance (RR)| Left Rotation|![alt text](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/avl-tree.jpg)|
| Left Left Unbalance (LL)| Right Rotation|![alt text](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/avl-tree2.jpg)|
| Left Right Unbalance (LR)| RR + LL <br>(Left Rotation + Right Rotation)|![alt text](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/avl-tree3.jpg) ![alt text](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/avl-tree4.jpg) ![alt text](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/avl-tree5.jpg) ![alt text](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/avl-tree6.jpg) ![alt text](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/avl-tree7.jpg)|
